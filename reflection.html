    <p> Our group meshed well together with great communication. We set our meetings and deadlines early and all completed our required sections 
    by the set deadlines. We started out well but needed to increase our pace towards the end, I feel we can improve on our motivation and priorities 
    during the festive seasons. I was surprised at the trust level involved when relying on everyone to meet deadlines. I learned that when working 
    in a group, managing deadlines and expectations requires a lot of communication. </p>

    <p> I believe our group had fantastic communication. This had a positive effect on the group environment, and everyone was always respectful. 
    It was surprising that everyone was honest about their schedule, and everyone was respectful and cooperative with each other. Despite unexpected 
    occurrences all members strived to complete their assigned tasks. One thing we could improve is maintaining our pace with our studies. Especially 
    working through the pandemic, many of us seemed worn out and this presented a challenge.  </p>
