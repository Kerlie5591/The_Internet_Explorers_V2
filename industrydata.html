	<b style="color: yellow"> Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not? </b>
	<br>
	<b> Bryce </b>
	<p> My ideal job is Software Developer, after reading the Burning Glass data, my opinion has still not changed. A lot of the general 
	and IT-specific skills required for my ideal job are all within the top section of the data. I still want to gain a career in programming 
	as I really enjoy writing code, especially seeing it finished and watching my work come to fruition, therefore my ideal job is still 
	Software Developer. </p>

	<b> Noah </b>

	<br>
	<b> Daniel </b>
	<p>  </p>
	<br>
	<b> Rhiannon </b>
	<p> No, my opinion of my ideal job has not changed. The Burning Glass data provided is already four years old and the IT industry has 
	evolved and improved since then. There are coding languages used today that weren’t listed, as well as IT roles that are becoming popular 
	and important in the field. I am still interested in pursuing a career as a Software Developer. </p>
