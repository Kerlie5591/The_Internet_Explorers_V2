  <h3> Detailed Description </h3>
  <br>	
  <p style="font-weight: bold;color: yellow"> AIMS </p>
  <br>	
  <p style="font-weight: bold"> Specific Aim </p>
  <p> The specific aim for our Versatile Fitness application is to develop and release an app that helps busy people increase their fitness levels. The way 
  our application will accomplish this is through developing the habit of exercising daily. The focus will be on short five-to-fifteen-minute calisthenic workout 
  routines that are developed by qualified physical training instructors, to ensure intensity and strength requirements are met for effectiveness. The most 
  important parts of our project will be ensuring the exercises are effective with the short workout times, and ensuring the workouts are versatile so they can 
  be performed anywhere, without extra equipment. We know how hard it is to prioritise exercising when there are other more immediate concerns that you feel should 
  be taken care of instead. Recent studies from the Australian Bureau of Statistics found that 67% of Australian adults were overweight or obese 
  (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2018). Being overweight or obese comes with all sorts of health problems such as high blood pressure, high levels of bad 
  cholesterol, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes, just to name a few (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2021). With these numbers we can clearly see there 
  is a need for weight loss to promote healthier Australians. Therefore, our specific aim is important as the people most at risk of neglecting exercise are parents 
  or people in general that feel they are too busy. Our plan is for our application to provide a way for the time constrained people to still enjoy the benefits of 
  exercising, without the need for any time-consuming commitments they can’t fit into their busy schedules. </p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;color: yellow"> Roles </p>
  <br>	
  <p> To assist us in staying on track with our project, we assigned roles to each group member based on their strengths in the previous assignment. The roles 
  include Project Developer, Graphic and UI Designer, Project Analyst, Technical Designer, and Content Technician. The first three roles are specific with the 
  last two being general all-rounder positions. The first specific position of Project Developer was assigned to Bryce, as he has previous experience with HTML, 
  CSS, and Kotlin programming languages. The position is responsible for developing and updating the project, maintaining the webpage, and ensuring all group 
  members meet the required deadlines. Bryce demonstrated previously that he could compile our written information to make it flow nicely, and efficiently used 
  his coding skills to incorporate the information into our webpage. The next specific position assigned was Graphic and UI Designer. This position is responsible 
  for any graphic or design related elements in the project, our webpage, and main documents for the assessment. This position went to Noah, as he is very talented 
  with creative design and was responsible for all our graphics in the previous assessment. Rhiannon was assigned the last specific role of Project Analyst. This 
  position is responsible for determining the requirements of the project, creating a breakdown of the essential components to be distributed to the required group 
  members, and reviewing completed work. Rhiannon was assigned this position as she previously demonstrated great organisational skills, and an ability to interpret 
  the project and section it into smaller, more manageable sections. These specific roles are vital to the success of our project; however, the general roles are 
  just as important and are arguably the backbone of the entire assignment.  </p>
  <br>	
  <p> The first general role of Content Technician was assigned to Daniel. This position is responsible for high-level content writing, ensuring academic writing 
  is well structured, and formatting rules are adhered to. Daniel was assigned this role as he has demonstrated great attention to detail, high-level of academic 
  writing and referencing, and the ability to be an all-rounder. The final role assigned was Technical Designer, which went to Hannah. This position is responsible 
  for any creative and detail-oriented content, brainstorming new ideas, and adapting new concepts to our current project. Hannah was assigned this role as she has 
  demonstrated high levels of creativity in her work, coming up with new innovative ideas, discovering ways to implement these ideas to our current work, and 
  consistently providing detail-oriented and well-structured content. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Although we all have roles assigned to us, they are interchangeable, and no doubt will be changed regularly as different aspects of the project require a 
  different viewpoint or area of expertise. In conclusion, our group members have all proven that we can produce high quality work and are all quite flexible and 
  open to new ideas. This has given us a solid foundation to work from and taught us all to adapt to different roles when required of us.  </p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;color: yellow"> Group Processes and Communication </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Communication amongst our group has been great since we first formed for the previous assessment. We acquired some valuable communication skills and learned 
  the best ways to communicate with each other. In this assessment, we plan to utilise the same communication techniques we used previously with minor changes. 
  Everyone in the group will ensure they have MS Teams installed on their personal computers and their mobile phones. We will communicate regularly via MS Teams 
  chat interface to ensure everyone in the group is on track with their scheduled workload, and so we won’t be caught unaware if a personal matter arises that may 
  affect our deadlines. We will also hold video meetings using MS Teams video calls twice a week, considering everyone’s schedules so we can all attend. During these 
  video meetings we will make sure we have a chair of the meeting, an agenda, and someone to take minutes. We will generally run these meetings in a similar fashion 
  each time. Commencing with seeing how everyone is coping with the set deadlines for each section assigned, discussing any issues or barriers that may have arisen, 
  assigning new deadlines for the next scheduled meeting, and discussing best time for our next meeting.  </p>
  <br>	
  <p> We haven’t experienced any issues with group members not responding to communications since the first week of the last assessment. However, we have a detailed 
  plan in place if this does occur. We will first attempt to contact the group member via a direct personal message in MS Teams chat, if this doesn’t receive a response 
  within 24 hours we will send an email to their student email address. If we still don’t receive a response within another 24 hours we will execute a video call through 
  MS Teams in attempt to contact them. If we still receive no response we will then contact our course coordinator via student email, explaining the current situation and 
  the methods of communication we have attempted, requesting advice on how to proceed. Overall, we believe we have a solid plan in place to ensure our communication 
  remains to a high standard throughout the course, ensuring we are prepared for any unforeseen circumstances that may arise. </p>
