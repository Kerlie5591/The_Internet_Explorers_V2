  I am 30 years old and was born in Australia. I am Caucasian and Indigenous Australian, and I only speak English. I enlisted in the Australian 
  Army as an Advanced Medical Technician early in life. During my time in the Army, I received my Diploma in Nursing and Diploma in Paramedical 
  Science as well as other Certificates in the medical field. I went on to study my Bachelor of Nursing, and after discharging I completed my 
  Certificate IV in Business Management and my Certificate IV in Security Management. I love spending time with my small family, my wife Tanya 
  and daughter Katara. I enjoy living an active lifestyle and every week go skating, boating, or hiking as a family. I also enjoy online gaming 
  and reading fantasy novels. I love IT and enjoy building computers, I have dabbled in app and webpage creation; I quite enjoy programming and 
  app development. My current IT experience is limited, I have only ever pursued it as a hobby, never having worked in the field. I joined RMIT’s 
  Bachelor of Information Technology to learn as much as possible about IT and start a career that I will enjoy, I hope to gain the knowledge to 
  become a software developer or work in cyber security. </p>

  My name is Hannah, I was born and raised in Sydney. I fluently speak Korean and lived in China for a short period of time just before the pandemic 
  to learn Chinese Mandarin. I enjoy playing music and majored in classical piano. During the pandemic, I started learning to play the guitar 
  on my own while watching YouTube tutorials. My favourite hobby is travelling and during peak holiday seasons, I am usually holiday-hopping. 
  My main interests in IT are Cyber Security and Artificial Intelligence. During my studies in diploma of IT, I was interested by methods
  which cyber criminals use to infiltrate computers and access data as well as ways that could mitigate it. My interest in artificial 
  intelligence peaked after learning about Tesla’s revolutionary Autopilot features and the ethics attached to artificial intelligence. </p>

  My name is Noah Etherington. I grew up in Hobart, Tasmania and started my working career as a chef. My hobbies include Gaming, Social sports, Listening
  to music and most importantly bush walking. I am currently running a fundraising campaign for the Cancer Council Australia in support of my terminally 
  ill grandmother, for every Tasmanian Abel I summit I will be donating $10 to the foundation in hopes to raise awareness and aid in prevention of the 
  illness. My interest in IT stems from building custom computers for friends and family and I hope to develop further knowledge in the software side of 
  computing. The Internet Explorers is a team made up of myself, Daniel, Hannah, and Bryce (Name creator) and we hope to aid each other in upcoming projects.</p>

  Hi, I’m Daniel, I’m a member of The Internet Explorers along with Bryce, Hannah, Noah and Rhiannon. I was born and raised and currently live in 
  Canberra, ACT. I'm Australian with a Māori heritage and I speak English. My passions include gaming, travelling, science, and hiking. I am interested 
  in artificial intelligence, what it can offer humanity, and the ethics involved in a quickly growing field with huge potential impact. I am specifically 
  interested in the field of machine learning and its ability to make sense of vast amounts of information. I’m also interested in computer hardware, I 
  enjoy building computers (then gaming on them) and keeping on top of current technology. For the past seven years I’ve worked as a polysomnographic 
  technician. This job requires acquisition, handing, and analysis of large amounts of biological data and a fair bit of client interaction. My goal is to 
  get the skills that will allow me to be a player in the developing field of artificial intelligence. </p>

  Hi, I’m Rhiannon, I live and work in Port Augusta, South Australia. I work full time as a data administrator in the rail industry. I’m a wife, mum, and 
  dog owner. In my spare time I like to create art and watch movies. I grew up in the 80’s and 90’s around computers and AV technology inspired by my dad 
  who had a love for all things IT. During quarantine I had a conversation with my best friend who is currently a year and a half into her Batchelor of 
  Social Work which she is completing online. I looked into what was now on offer and seeing that a wide variety of IT courses were available to me I jumped 
  at the chance. I am interested in software development, learning more about computer programming and cyber security. </p>

  <h3> Group Processes </h3>
  <br>
  <p> o	How well did your group work together in Assignment 2? Will you be introducing any changes in process for Assignment 3? 
   o	Take GROUP REFLECTION section from A2 and use it to do this section. </p>
  <br><br>

  <h3> Career Plans </h3>
  <br>
  <p style="font-weight: bold"> Test Results: </p>
  <br>
  <p> o	Include our test results, compare and discuss the differences between our ideal jobs (use IDEAL JOBS section from A2 and expand)… This may have changed 
  due to feedback from Assignments 1 and 2. Not likely to receive grades in time so ignore this part.
  o	What common elements are there, if any? 
  o	What differentiates each position from the others, if anything? 
  o	How similar or different are your career plans across the group?

  <br>
  <p> Psychometric tests can help to determine the ideal composition of a group, and our combined test results show that we are well matched. In our group, 
  according to the test results, we have an assertive leader type with a strong sense of commitment and great attention to detail, a confident mediator that 
  can ensure everyone’s voices are heard and are treated fairly, two enthusiastic and strong communicators that are creative and capable of exploring new 
  ideas, and a determined, rational, and versatile individual that can bring focus to the group. With our group members knowing each other’s personality and 
  learning types, this enables effective communication and collaboration. For example, Architects tend to appear standoffish, yet this is due to them being 
  logical and can be perceived as being blunt. By understanding this, situations where tensions may arise due to other personality types perceiving Architects 
  as being dismissive can be discussed or understood before occurring. Another advantage is knowing who may be best suited to certain situations before they 
  occur. For example, we have a Mediator, this will be good because they are creative, passionate, open-minded, and empathetic. However, they can have tendencies 
  to be self-critical, which can lead them to have unrealistic expectations for themselves and beat themselves up when they don’t live up to these expectations.
  We also have 2 Architects and 2 Campaigners. This means we know we have two members who may need help to abide by deadlines and can be disorganised or unfocused, 
  but are talented in communication, enthusiastic, and perceptive. We also have two people who are solution focused and determined but can be single minded. </p>
  <br>
  <p> The advantage of knowing each group member’s learning style is also important, especially when collaborating over the internet. It allows the group to utilise 
  techniques such as virtual whiteboards or transcripts of meetings to ensure each member can learn in the opportune way for them. Even if these psychometric 
  tests are not 100% accurate for everyone, they provide a basis on which the group can utilise to work effectively, particularly at the start of a collaboration 
  when individuals may not have experience with group work or specific team members. With all our team members understanding each other’s personality and learning 
  styles, we will be well-equipped to handle any challenges that may surface, and ensure we work well together to complete all tasks efficiently and effectively. </p>
