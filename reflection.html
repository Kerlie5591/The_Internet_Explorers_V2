    <p> Our group, The Internet Explorers, maintained great communication throughout and got along well. Even though we had a few personal issues arise, everyone 
    worked together to ensure deadlines were met and help each other. We had a solid plan that solved any issues from the last assessment. We all feel we worked effectively 
    together and understood each other’s strengths and utilised them appropriately. Although we performed well together, there are areas we could improve. We feel we could 
    improve our decision making when it comes to creative elements and pushing each other to do better. We could’ve challenged each other more; we all knew things were not 
    progressing as quickly as they should, and we misinterpreted the fact that we worked well together as reassurance that we were accomplishing our objectives in adequate 
    time. As a team, we need to improve our confidence when it comes to speaking out and challenging each other. Even though we became a little complacent and maybe too 
    comfortable with each other, overall, we are proud of our accomplishments within the team and the outcome of our project. </p>

    <p> During our time in The Internet Explorers, we discovered some surprising developments that we feel could only be experienced in a well-functioning group. 
    Going into the assessments, we thought we would just complete our own assigned sections and trust each other to do the same. Some of us were surprised to len that 
    working so closely with each other and sharing our interests, developed strong bonds that will most likely last for years to come well beyond the scope of this course. 
    During this assessment we learned that groups grow to care for each other and are always willing to provide help. Crucial to our success in accomplishing our goals, 
    we learned to reflect on our strengths and weaknesses and use our contacts, bringing them together to create a team that was more efficient and effective than any of 
    us could’ve been individually. We came to realise that groups are not just about the skills and experience of the individuals, but more of a collective effort that 
    gradually develops to form its own identity. In conclusion, we had a successful team, and no major changes were really needed. Each of us can take something away from 
    this experience to enhance our effectiveness working in teams for future projects and are grateful for the privilege of working together. </p>
