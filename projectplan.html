  <p style="font-weight: bold;color: yellow"> Motivation </p>
  <br>	
  <p> As of 2018, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (2018) found that 67% of Australian adults were either overweight or obese, which is an increase from 
  63.4% in 2015 as seen below in figure 1.1. This study was done on 12.5 million people. A current study concluded that only 17.6% of parents exercised regularly, 
  this can be attributed to many factors, the biggest one being parents saying they would prefer to spend their free time interacting with their children 
  (Sukys et al. 2014). As cited by Samataro (2015), a recent study from the University of Pittsburgh revealed that couples or singles without children were less 
  sedentary than parents. This is a problem as children’s fitness levels, which are vitally important to their personality development, are closely attributed to 
  their parent’s exercise habits (Sukys et al. 2014). Samataro (2015) believes this issue is due to the commitments, prioritisation, and unpredictability of parenting. 
  This results in parents finding it difficult to create and maintain a schedule, often neglecting exercise. Hargreaves (2021) discusses the importance of regular 
  exercise and fitness levels being associated with improved well-being, enhanced life, and overall happiness. For centuries regular exercise has been associated 
  with a longer life span and a healthy immune system, however it is only recently that the biological bases of this association has been clearly proven and explained 
  (Hargreaves 2021). With the most recent studies proving the positive effects of exercise on mental health and overall feelings of happiness, parents who exercise 
  will find themselves being more satisfied with themselves and are more likely to live more fulfilling lives. With the increase in overweight and obese Australians, 
  and with many people feeling like they don’t have enough time to exercise, it is more important than ever to promote easily accessible exercise alternatives. </p>
  <br>
  <p> Our project offers a solution in the form of an android application by providing a time-effective workout routine with varying intensities that can include 
  children. The features of the app will allow parents to easily slot exercise into their busy days and will help provide motivation through motivational quotes and 
  picture. An advanced notification system will help keep the user engaged with the application by sending push notifications with reminders and affirmations regarding 
  their progress. This is important when considering our motivations for designing this app. Parents have high levels of stress when concerning time-management and 
  often neglect themselves to ensure their children are well-cared for. We feel it is important for Versatile Fitness to encourage child involvement due to how important 
  it is for children to be exposed to regular exercise in their formative years (Skouteris et al. 2010). Our app, Versatile Fitness, is aimed primarily at 
  time-constrained parents, however anyone can use it. Our goal is to create a fitness app that will facilitate frequent physical activity for a parent and their child 
  or children, or just the parent, but ultimately to keep busy people physically active. By keeping this at-risk demographic active we hope to help combat the obesity 
  epidemic in Australia by promoting healthy habits in parents and children, thus simultaneously treating the issue, and preventing it. </p>
  <br>
  <p> Throughout the span of this project, we as a team will develop specialised skills related to the task of building a fitness application for an android device. 
  To write the code for Versatile Fitness we will learn to code in the Kotlin and Java languages, we don’t expect to become experts in the languages in the timeframe 
  of this project. However, we hope to develop enough competency to produce some functional features of the app with plans to outsource the final work or do it ourselves 
  in an extended timeframe. We will greatly expand our skills of working effectively in a team, namely, we will become experts at setting priorities, and meeting strict 
  deadlines. A major part of developing Versatile Fitness will be collaborating with experts in external fields such as fitness and programming, we have and will continue 
  to reach out to contacts in relevant fields and seek their expert advice. </p>
  <br>
  <p> Our application fits in with current IT trends as it is a fitness app that can be used anywhere at any time, these types of exercise apps have become very popular 
  due to COVID-19 and lockdowns. According to a report by Grand View Research (2022) the market size for fitness apps in 2021 was 1.1 billion USD with an expected annual 
  compound growth rate of 17.6% over the next decade. The report goes on to explain this exceptional growth rate being a result of the waves of global Covid-19 lockdowns 
  giving in-app fitness the edge over gyms and studios. The American College of Sport and Medicine’s Health & Fitness Journal published a report by Walter Thompson (2022) 
  which has mobile exercise apps as the 13th most popular trend for 2022, with wearable technology and home gyms being the first and second most popular trend. Interestingly 
  home gyms have made their first ever appearance in the report, likely due again to the Covid-19 lockdowns. </p>
  <br>
  <p> The biggest drawback we foresee is visibility, there are currently similar apps, and they may not have all the same features, but they have been in the market for 
  a while, making it harder to convince people that our app will be beneficial. Besides visibility, another drawback would be marketing the product. As our app is aimed 
  mainly at time-constrained individuals or people without much motivation to exercise, potential users may not initially see the benefit of utilising our app. This is 
  where it is our job to make sure the app is presented and marketed in a way that is very appealing to potential users and iterates the main features in a way that draws 
  these potential users into trying it out. </p>

  <br>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;color: yellow"> Landscape </p>
  <br>	
  <p> The global mobile fitness app market is huge and growing fast, with one report predicting the market share to reach $120.37 billion USD by 2030 (Borasi et al. 2021). 
  In 2019 there were 37,143 fitness and health apps on the Google Play store (Ceci, L 2019), these apps range from fitness apps, to sleep cycle trackers and meal prep apps. 
  Due to the saturation of the market with similar products to Versatile Fitness, I have selected three examples of successful and similar apps which I will compare with 
  Versatile Fitness. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> The most successful fitness app currently is MyFitnessPal, which launched in 2005 as a calorie counter tool but has since grown to be an all-encompassing fitness app 
  that generated $128 million USD in revenue in 2020. The only area where MyFitnessPal overlaps with Versatile Fitness, though, is in the workout routines feature set. This 
  area of the app includes a library of multi-exercise routines which can be customised by the user. The user can pick and choose which exercises they would like to do in 
  each routine as well as number of sets and reps. Each exercise is accompanied by a video displaying how to perform it. There are trainer tips, and time gates including a 
  rest interval between exercises (MyFitnessPal 2021). These are all similar features to what Versatile Fitness offers; however, MyFitnessPal doesn’t have any aspect of 
  child-involved workouts and doesn’t market itself specifically as a time-friendly at-home workout app. Though the overlap of features isn’t large between MyFitnessPal and 
  Versatile Fitness, due to the share of the market that it commands it will be a difficult process to try and convince people to try a different app. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Another wildly successful fitness app is FitOn, which launched in 2019 and has over 4 million registered users. FitOn offers a social workout experience from your 
  home by offering pre-recorded classes of many different types that you can attend virtually with your friends. It allows integration with wearable technology, and leader 
  boards aimed at fostering friendly competition. You can sync FitOn with your google calendar helping you organise your workout routine around your schedule. You can set a 
  fitness goal and form a specific plan with a custom length; you can fill your plan with your favourite classes. There is a notification system which can be set up to remind 
  you on specific days to ‘get your fix’ (FitOn 2022).  FitOn doesn’t quite offer any overlapping features that Versatile Fitness offers but there are overlaps in concepts, 
  such as the notification customisation, though Versatile Fitness leans more into keeping the user motivated via quotes and encouragement. Another overlap, though not a direct 
  feature overlap and more of a goal overlap, is the calendar, giving the user a tool to fit exercise into a busy schedule. Versatile Fitness takes a more on-the-go approach 
  to time management where the user can drop what they are doing and get a quick workout in. Both approaches may appeal to similar demographics so there may be some 
  competition there. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Sworkit is a company with an accompanying fitness apps that was launched in 2012, which now has 10 million registered users. Sworkit offers highly customisable workout 
  routines with features that include, workout time, length of each exercise, rest breaks between exercises, which exercises are included in the current workout and 
  instructional cues allowing you to change what your trainers voice sounds like. Sworkit offers access to certified fitness trainers through means of an in-app help centre, 
  where the user can ask for tailored advice regarding their fitness goals or even nutritional guidance (Sworkit 2022). There is an obvious overlap in Sworkit and Versatile 
  Fitness, and with a 9-year head-start on development Sworkit is no doubt ahead of us. Where these overlaps lie are in the workout presentations, though this kind of 
  functionality is very common across many fitness apps. Where the rarer overlap between these two apps occurs is in the exercises being offered to children. Sworkit has an 
  application called Sworkit Kids. This app is full of workout routines designed to engage and entertain children of all ages (Sworkit Kids 2022). Though from what I could 
  find in my research, Sworkit Kids doesn’t offer mixed workouts for parent and child, they seem to be more aimed at groups of children specifically. Both Sworkit and 
  Versatile Fitness have a mission to tackle adult and childhood obesity in their communities. Where Versatile Fitness differs from Sworkit is in the emphasis Versatile 
  Fitness places on parent and child interaction during a workout, fostering healthy habits to prevent obesity from occurring in the child at all. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> The fitness application market is vast and varied, there are many fitness apps that do many different things. All the features in Versatile Fitness are spread out 
  in other apps, barring the parent and child interaction, on the market, but I didn’t come across one app that has all the features Versatile Fitness has in one place. 
  For this reason, I think Versatile Fitness can find a niche in the landscape and become a viable market force. </p>

  <h3> Detailed Description </h3>
  <br>	
  <p style="font-weight: bold;color: yellow"> AIMS </p>
  <br>	
  <p style="font-weight: bold"> Specific Aim </p>
  <p> The specific aim for our Versatile Fitness application is to develop and release an app that helps busy people increase their fitness levels. The way 
  our application will accomplish this is through developing the habit of exercising daily. The focus will be on short five-to-fifteen-minute calisthenic workout 
  routines that are developed by qualified physical training instructors, to ensure intensity and strength requirements are met for effectiveness. The most 
  important parts of our project will be ensuring the exercises are effective with the short workout times, and ensuring the workouts are versatile so they can 
  be performed anywhere, without extra equipment. We know how hard it is to prioritise exercising when there are other more immediate concerns that you feel should 
  be taken care of instead. Recent studies from the Australian Bureau of Statistics found that 67% of Australian adults were overweight or obese 
  (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2018). Being overweight or obese comes with all sorts of health problems such as high blood pressure, high levels of bad 
  cholesterol, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes, just to name a few (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2021). With these numbers we can clearly see there 
  is a need for weight loss to promote healthier Australians. Therefore, our specific aim is important as the people most at risk of neglecting exercise are parents 
  or people in general that feel they are too busy. Our plan is for our application to provide a way for the time constrained people to still enjoy the benefits of 
  exercising, without the need for any time-consuming commitments they can’t fit into their busy schedules. </p>
  <br>	
  <p style="font-weight: bold"> Goal One – Create a variety of workout plans for different fitness levels </p>
  <p> One of our main goals with the Versatile Fitness application is to support a wide range of fitness levels for people in all walks of life. Discrimination is 
  something that is easily visible in the health and wellbeing sector, and we want to completely eradicate that with our application. To achieve this goal, we have 
  sought help from trained professionals to develop us base workout plans to help us understand and develop further ones. At the current time we have gained a full 
  workout plan for an intermediate level from an acquaintance that is a CPL PTI (Corporal Physical Training Instructor). With the information and planning he has 
  given to us; we plan to scale the workout up and down to accommodate multiple fitness levels. Along with our connection with the CPL PTI, we have been communicating 
  with primary school PE teachers with multiple years of experience to help us intergrade the children element into our application. Gaining information from someone 
  who has worked with kids for some years, will help us understand what kids like and what they do not, which in a workout environment is especially important. 
  This information we gain over the next few weeks will aid us in achieving our goal of full support to all that wish to workout, by supplying them with a workout 
  plan that has been provided by trained professionals. These workout plans will be available in multiple fashions to accommodate those in a rush, those with kids, 
  those who want to experience the full workout and those who want to get their health into shape but feel their daily lives interfere with that goal.  </p>
  <br>	
  <p style="font-weight: bold"> Goal Two – Incorporate Kotlin/Java programming code in application to add features </p>
  <p> While the long-term aim of Versatile Fitness is to develop a fully functional android application, in the short-term we have set goals to produce some fully 
  functional sub-features using the Kotlin language. This way we can demonstrate aspects of the functionality of the final product and further, we can demonstrate 
  our ability to code with purpose in a language that is growing in popularity, fully supported by Google, and fully interchangeable with Java. <br><br>
  Some features we aim to demonstrate in the first ten weeks of development include: <br>
  •	Countdown timers for the workouts <br>
  •	Workout selection page with multiple workout choices available <br>
  •	Exercise screen that includes: <br>
    o	Exercise name <br>
    o	Rep number <br>
    o	Gif image showing required movements for exercise to be done in a safe and effective manner <br>
    o	Text indicator of how many exercises required in total <br>
    o	Stopwatch of overall workout time <br>
    o	Next exercise button <br>
    o	Quit button <br>
  •	A ‘next’ button which changes the exercise in the same fragment <br>
  •	A congratulations page for after all exercises are completed, returning user to the main menu <br>
  •	A quit screen with a ‘restart workout’ button and ‘return to main menu’ button <br><br>
  In the January 2022 index from TIOBE, which takes information from across the internet, Kotlin is placed as the 29th most used programming language, up from position 
  40 in 2021. Whilst not the most used language, it is a newer language, and language adoption is a slow process. We have chosen Kotlin due to its concise manner and 
  simplicity, as well as the close support it receives from google. 
  </p>
  <br>	
  <p style="font-weight: bold"> Goal Three – Develop a user-friendly interface for the mobile application </p>
  <p> For users to enjoy using our application, it is crucial to develop a user-friendly interface. Heuristic analysis is a popular approach in user interface designs. 
  Our application will apply Nielsen’s heuristic principles to provide a user-friendly interface since it will increase usability, making users want to use our application 
  and return to it. Faria Gomes and Costa de Souza (2021) explain that users use mobile workout apps for three reasons: (1) to achieve a task, (2) to be entertained and (3) 
  to socially engage with others. We will aim to apply these needs of the users when designing our interface. We will try to make our application visually minimalistic, 
  simple enough that users do not feel that they are exercising their brain to find out how this application is working or to help users not feel the need that they must 
  learn how to use this application to start working out with it. Especially for time constrained parents, it is important to make steps easily understood and make the app 
  easy to use. There will be simple instructions displayed across the application, especially for new users so that users can easily navigate across the interface and 
  application. There is an opportunity to gamify the workouts which will engage users and heighten their experience. Social interactions will also be made enjoyable with 
  appealing designs on the interface so that the social connection becomes a motivational and feel-good boost for users. With an easy-to-use interface and visually pleasing 
  aspects, our application will not only be a health benefit for users but become an enjoyable experience for users. </p>
  <br>	
  <p style="font-weight: bold"> Goal Four – Finalise application, debug, and find users to test the application </p>
  <p> Several steps will be required before the app can be released for beta testing. Firstly, before releasing the app the code should be run through the debugger built 
  into Android Studio, which will find and flag any errors in the code, followed by testing the app within Android Studio. Next the app can be tested in Android Profiler, 
  which is also built into Android Studio. This will determine how the app interacts with the memory, network, and battery of the device it is installed on. The app will 
  then need to be versioned. Version information is required for any maintenance or upgrading plans. Android requires all apps to have a digitally signed certificate, 
  signed with an upload key, before they will allow the app to be made available in the Google Play store. Once all these steps are complete the app is ready for beta 
  testing. Beta testers can be found in several ways. They can be personally sourced. There are also communities on social media, including Reddit and Facebook, made up 
  of people who will offer their services. It should be decided how many testers will have access to the app. The feedback from the testers will allow us to modify features 
  of the app dependent on the recommendations made. This goal is important as debugging and testing the app will allow us to ensure the app runs smoothly, doesn’t crash, 
  and the user experience will be enjoyable. </p>

  <br><br>
	  
  <p style="font-weight: bold;color: yellow"> Roles </p>
  <br>	
  <p> To assist us in staying on track with our project, we assigned roles to each group member based on their strengths in the previous assignment. The roles 
  include Project Developer, Graphic and UI Designer, Project Analyst, Technical Designer, and Content Technician. The first three roles are specific with the 
  last two being general all-rounder positions. The first specific position of Project Developer was assigned to Bryce, as he has previous experience with HTML, 
  CSS, and Kotlin programming languages. The position is responsible for developing and updating the project, maintaining the webpage, and ensuring all group 
  members meet the required deadlines. Bryce demonstrated previously that he could compile our written information to make it flow nicely, and efficiently used 
  his coding skills to incorporate the information into our webpage. The next specific position assigned was Graphic and UI Designer. This position is responsible 
  for any graphic or design related elements in the project, our webpage, and main documents for the assessment. This position went to Noah, as he is very talented 
  with creative design and was responsible for all our graphics in the previous assessment. Rhiannon was assigned the last specific role of Project Analyst. This 
  position is responsible for determining the requirements of the project, creating a breakdown of the essential components to be distributed to the required group 
  members, and reviewing completed work. Rhiannon was assigned this position as she previously demonstrated great organisational skills, and an ability to interpret 
  the project and section it into smaller, more manageable sections. These specific roles are vital to the success of our project; however, the general roles are 
  just as important and are arguably the backbone of the entire assignment.  </p>
  <br>	
  <p> The first general role of Content Technician was assigned to Daniel. This position is responsible for high-level content writing, ensuring academic writing 
  is well structured, and formatting rules are adhered to. Daniel was assigned this role as he has demonstrated great attention to detail, high-level of academic 
  writing and referencing, and the ability to be an all-rounder. The final role assigned was Technical Designer, which went to Hannah. This position is responsible 
  for any creative and detail-oriented content, brainstorming new ideas, and adapting new concepts to our current project. Hannah was assigned this role as she has 
  demonstrated high levels of creativity in her work, coming up with new innovative ideas, discovering ways to implement these ideas to our current work, and 
  consistently providing detail-oriented and well-structured content. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Although we all have roles assigned to us, they are interchangeable, and no doubt will be changed regularly as different aspects of the project require a 
  different viewpoint or area of expertise. In conclusion, our group members have all proven that we can produce high quality work and are all quite flexible and 
  open to new ideas. This has given us a solid foundation to work from and taught us all to adapt to different roles when required of us.  </p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;color: yellow"> Group Processes and Communication </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Communication amongst our group has been great since we first formed for the previous assessment. We acquired some valuable communication skills and learned 
  the best ways to communicate with each other. In this assessment, we plan to utilise the same communication techniques we used previously with minor changes. 
  Everyone in the group will ensure they have MS Teams installed on their personal computers and their mobile phones. We will communicate regularly via MS Teams 
  chat interface to ensure everyone in the group is on track with their scheduled workload, and so we won’t be caught unaware if a personal matter arises that may 
  affect our deadlines. We will also hold video meetings using MS Teams video calls twice a week, considering everyone’s schedules so we can all attend. During these 
  video meetings we will make sure we have a chair of the meeting, an agenda, and someone to take minutes. We will generally run these meetings in a similar fashion 
  each time. Commencing with seeing how everyone is coping with the set deadlines for each section assigned, discussing any issues or barriers that may have arisen, 
  assigning new deadlines for the next scheduled meeting, and discussing best time for our next meeting.  </p>
  <br>	
  <p> We haven’t experienced any issues with group members not responding to communications since the first week of the last assessment. However, we have a detailed 
  plan in place if this does occur. We will first attempt to contact the group member via a direct personal message in MS Teams chat, if this doesn’t receive a response 
  within 24 hours we will send an email to their student email address. If we still don’t receive a response within another 24 hours we will execute a video call through 
  MS Teams in attempt to contact them. If we still receive no response we will then contact our course coordinator via student email, explaining the current situation and 
  the methods of communication we have attempted, requesting advice on how to proceed. Overall, we believe we have a solid plan in place to ensure our communication 
  remains to a high standard throughout the course, ensuring we are prepared for any unforeseen circumstances that may arise. </p>
