  <h1> VERSATILE FITNESS APP PROJECT ARTEFACTS </h1>

  <h3> Workout Plan for our application: </h3>

  <p> Versatile Fitness App focusses on calisthenics workouts to help improve the user’s fitness levels with just a 5 to 15-minute workout per day. 
  Calisthenics exercises build strength and endurance using only the bodyweight of the person, without the use of resistance devices or weights, and all 
  calisthenics exercises are modifiable to suit any fitness level. The advantage of calisthenics is that the workouts can be done anywhere, anytime as 
  there is no need for any extra tools. There are many benefits to using calisthenics for quick workouts. A proper calisthenics workout plan can help a 
  person meet the recommendations of at least 2 days of strength training per week, and all calisthenics workouts target multiple muscle groups, as set 
  out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Villines 2021). </p>

  <h3> Images showcasing our vision of each screen for our final application: </h3>
  <br>	
  <p> I believe our group had fantastic communication. This had a positive effect on the group environment, and everyone was always respectful. 
  It was surprising that everyone was honest about their schedule, and everyone was respectful and cooperative with each other. Despite unexpected 
  occurrences all members strived to complete their assigned tasks. One thing we could improve is maintaining our pace with our studies. Especially 
  working through the pandemic, many of us seemed worn out and this presented a challenge. </p>
  <br><br>

  <h3> Navigation graph for our vision of the final product: </h3>
  <br>	
  <p> I consider myself lucky when it comes to our group for assignment 2. What started as a bond over general interests has turned into a solid 
  foundation for a group. Everyone turned up to every meeting on time and all contributed a satisfactory amount. Throughout the assignment we supported 
  each other's work through MS team's chat. While it was work focused, we managed to slip support and interest for each other's personal lives into the 
  chat and for that I am grateful. </p>

  <h3> Video on our current development progress using Android Studio Emulator and Kotlin programming language: </h3>
  <br>	
  <p> Our group worked very well together, we were all motivated and supportive of each other. We effectively identified the project areas that 
  required the most effort and set deadlines early to get them out of the way. I was surprised by how much communication is required in a group setting 
  to organise deadlines and set workloads. I learned that meetings work a lot better when they are well organised with an agenda and chairperson. One 
  area we could have improved on is providing feedback on each other’s work. </p>
