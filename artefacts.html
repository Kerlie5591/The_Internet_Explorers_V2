  <h3> Bryce </h3>
  <br>	
  <p> Our group meshed well together with great communication. We set our meetings and deadlines early and all completed our required sections 
  by the set deadlines. We started out well but needed to increase our pace towards the end, I feel we can improve on our motivation and priorities 
  during the festive seasons. I was surprised at the trust level involved when relying on everyone to meet deadlines. I learned that when working 
  in a group, managing deadlines and expectations requires a lot of communication. </p>

  <h3> Hannah </h3>
  <br>	
  <p> I believe our group had fantastic communication. This had a positive effect on the group environment, and everyone was always respectful. 
  It was surprising that everyone was honest about their schedule, and everyone was respectful and cooperative with each other. Despite unexpected 
  occurrences all members strived to complete their assigned tasks. One thing we could improve is maintaining our pace with our studies. Especially 
  working through the pandemic, many of us seemed worn out and this presented a challenge.  </p>

  <h3> Noah </h3>
  <br>	
  <p> I consider myself lucky when it comes to our group for assignment 2. What started as a bond over general interests has turned into a solid 
  foundation for a group. Everyone turned up to every meeting on time and all contributed a satisfactory amount. Throughout the assignment we supported 
  each other's work through MS team's chat. While it was work focused, we managed to slip support and interest for each other's personal lives into the 
  chat and for that I am grateful. </p>

  <h3> Daniel </h3>
  <br>	
  <p> Our group worked very well together, we were all motivated and supportive of each other. We effectively identified the project areas that 
  required the most effort and set deadlines early to get them out of the way. I was surprised by how much communication is required in a group setting 
  to organise deadlines and set workloads. I learned that meetings work a lot better when they are well organised with an agenda and chairperson. One 
  area we could have improved on is providing feedback on each other’s work. </p>

  <h3> Rhiannon </h3>
  <br>	
  <p> Our team worked well together, our communication was great, and we completed the work while enjoying ourselves. Everyone was polite and respectful. 
  I joined late and had trepidations about having enough to contribute but I wasn’t made to feel that way, we all supported each other. I think our group 
  could improve on our motivation, especially towards the end. Overall, the Internet Explorers are a great group of people and I look forward to working 
  with them again. </p>
