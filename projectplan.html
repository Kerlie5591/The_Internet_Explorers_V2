  <h1> Project Plan - Versatile Fitness </h1>
  <h3> An exercise app for time-constrained parents </h3>

  <br><br>
  <p> Our project is an innovative fitness app that is targeted towards parents and other time-constrained people. Initially the group will need to undertake pre-planning, 
  clearly laying out the concept of the app in a brainstorming session by preparing a short description of the app and pinpointing the core ideas in simple terms. This will 
  define the concept among the team. The aims and outcomes of the app will need to be developed. Researching and deciding upon the target market will help to identify 
  potential users and allow us to develop a more precise plan to deliver a successful application. The team would also need to research any apps that are currently on the 
  market to ensure the app will standout with some unique features, offering an individual experience to the user. Testing the top apps in the market for similarities or 
  faults will help to refine the overall idea of the app. The name, Versatile Fitness, is the current name for our app. However, we are planning to brainstorm new names to 
  ensure our app has the best chances possible of catching the eyes of potential users scrolling through the Play Store. </p>
  <br>
  <p> Once the planning is complete, and the user interface and the functional requirements for the app have been established, then the research can be fine-tuned. From 
  here the work can begin on turning the app into a tangible product, starting with producing artefacts of the envisioned result. After the team have mapped the requirements 
  for the app, the team will need to plan and identify deliverable milestones. The development milestones will need to be mapped out and initial deadlines created for tasks 
  to be completed. The team will need to identify the skills needed for the app’s development. Before coding and the app’s development process begins, the team will need to 
  finalise the technical architecture and technology stack (hardware and software) to be used during development. The coding language and platform to which the app will be 
  developed through will be Kotlin and Java using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Next, the appearance of the app will need to be planned. It will require a 
  clean and easy to use format to guarantee satisfaction in user experience. </p>
  <br>
  <p> The team will need to create a design that makes the app interactive and user-friendly, while also being visually appealing, taking into consideration space, 
  line, and colours. Visual elements need to be planned. These need to be intuitive enough to keep the user’s interest, but not too overbearing to distract the user while 
  using the app. The visual appeal also needs to be different to existing apps, as researched in the initial planning phase, so that the user experience is unique. Any 
  logos and graphics for use on external platforms such as social media will need to be designed. Regular quality assurance testing during the app development process 
  needs to occur to ensure that the app is stable, usable, and secure. Testing can be done in several ways, through an emulator during the creation process, and end user 
  testing once the app is finished. The team will need to find volunteers to beta test the app. The technical feasibility of the app will need to also be tested. Is the 
  app battery friendly? Does it overwork the CPU? Is it secure? Some of the project parameters may need to be refined depending on the technical requirements, after 
  consulting with the relevant professionals. On completion of these tasks, and once the team is satisfied with the test outcomes, we will use Bryce’s developer account 
  on the Google Play Store. After the app has been approved and is available on the app store, its usage can be monitored through mobile analytics platforms and KPIs can 
  be tracked, measuring the app’s success. Crash reports and other issues will need to be regularly monitored and the apps forums page will need to be monitored for 
  recommended changes or any bugs that have been identified by users. </p>
  <br>
  <p> The plan is to create an app that is user friendly and health focused, while allowing for real life events and interruptions. Our overall goal is to create an 
  application that will be both easily accessible and affordable for everyone. Allowing anyone that feels like they don’t have time to work out, but would like to improve 
  their health, to be able to fit an effective workout routine into their busy schedules. </p>
  <br><br>

  <br><br>
  <p> As of 2018, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (2018) found that 67% of Australian adults were either overweight or obese, which is an increase from 
  63.4% in 2015 as seen below in figure 1.1. This study was done on 12.5 million people. A current study concluded that only 17.6% of parents exercised regularly, 
  this can be attributed to many factors, the biggest one being parents saying they would prefer to spend their free time interacting with their children 
  (Sukys et al. 2014). As cited by Samataro (2015), a recent study from the University of Pittsburgh revealed that couples or singles without children were less 
  sedentary than parents. This is a problem as children’s fitness levels, which are vitally important to their personality development, are closely attributed to 
  their parent’s exercise habits (Sukys et al. 2014). Samataro (2015) believes this issue is due to the commitments, prioritisation, and unpredictability of parenting. 
  This results in parents finding it difficult to create and maintain a schedule, often neglecting exercise. Hargreaves (2021) discusses the importance of regular 
  exercise and fitness levels being associated with improved well-being, enhanced life, and overall happiness. For centuries regular exercise has been associated 
  with a longer life span and a healthy immune system, however it is only recently that the biological bases of this association has been clearly proven and explained 
  (Hargreaves 2021). With the most recent studies proving the positive effects of exercise on mental health and overall feelings of happiness, parents who exercise 
  will find themselves being more satisfied with themselves and are more likely to live more fulfilling lives. With the increase in overweight and obese Australians, 
  and with many people feeling like they don’t have enough time to exercise, it is more important than ever to promote easily accessible exercise alternatives. </p>
  <br>
  <p> Our project offers a solution in the form of an android application by providing a time-effective workout routine with varying intensities that can include 
  children. The features of the app will allow parents to easily slot exercise into their busy days and will help provide motivation through motivational quotes and 
  picture. An advanced notification system will help keep the user engaged with the application by sending push notifications with reminders and affirmations regarding 
  their progress. This is important when considering our motivations for designing this app. Parents have high levels of stress when concerning time-management and 
  often neglect themselves to ensure their children are well-cared for. We feel it is important for Versatile Fitness to encourage child involvement due to how important 
  it is for children to be exposed to regular exercise in their formative years (Skouteris et al. 2010). Our app, Versatile Fitness, is aimed primarily at 
  time-constrained parents, however anyone can use it. Our goal is to create a fitness app that will facilitate frequent physical activity for a parent and their child 
  or children, or just the parent, but ultimately to keep busy people physically active. By keeping this at-risk demographic active we hope to help combat the obesity 
  epidemic in Australia by promoting healthy habits in parents and children, thus simultaneously treating the issue, and preventing it. </p>
  <br>
  <p> Throughout the span of this project, we as a team will develop specialised skills related to the task of building a fitness application for an android device. 
  To write the code for Versatile Fitness we will learn to code in the Kotlin and Java languages, we don’t expect to become experts in the languages in the timeframe 
  of this project. However, we hope to develop enough competency to produce some functional features of the app with plans to outsource the final work or do it ourselves 
  in an extended timeframe. We will greatly expand our skills of working effectively in a team, namely, we will become experts at setting priorities, and meeting strict 
  deadlines. A major part of developing Versatile Fitness will be collaborating with experts in external fields such as fitness and programming, we have and will continue 
  to reach out to contacts in relevant fields and seek their expert advice. </p>
  <br>
  <p> Our application fits in with current IT trends as it is a fitness app that can be used anywhere at any time, these types of exercise apps have become very popular 
  due to COVID-19 and lockdowns. According to a report by Grand View Research (2022) the market size for fitness apps in 2021 was 1.1 billion USD with an expected annual 
  compound growth rate of 17.6% over the next decade. The report goes on to explain this exceptional growth rate being a result of the waves of global Covid-19 lockdowns 
  giving in-app fitness the edge over gyms and studios. The American College of Sport and Medicine’s Health & Fitness Journal published a report by Walter Thompson (2022) 
  which has mobile exercise apps as the 13th most popular trend for 2022, with wearable technology and home gyms being the first and second most popular trend. Interestingly 
  home gyms have made their first ever appearance in the report, likely due again to the Covid-19 lockdowns. </p>
  <br>
  <p> The biggest drawback we foresee is visibility, there are currently similar apps, and they may not have all the same features, but they have been in the market for 
  a while, making it harder to convince people that our app will be beneficial. Besides visibility, another drawback would be marketing the product. As our app is aimed 
  mainly at time-constrained individuals or people without much motivation to exercise, potential users may not initially see the benefit of utilising our app. This is 
  where it is our job to make sure the app is presented and marketed in a way that is very appealing to potential users and iterates the main features in a way that draws 
  these potential users into trying it out. </p>

  <p> The global mobile fitness app market is huge and growing fast, with one report predicting the market share to reach $120.37 billion USD by 2030 (Borasi et al. 2021). 
  In 2019 there were 37,143 fitness and health apps on the Google Play store (Ceci, L 2019), these apps range from fitness apps, to sleep cycle trackers and meal prep apps. 
  Due to the saturation of the market with similar products to Versatile Fitness, I have selected three examples of successful and similar apps which I will compare with 
  Versatile Fitness. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> The most successful fitness app currently is MyFitnessPal, which launched in 2005 as a calorie counter tool but has since grown to be an all-encompassing fitness app 
  that generated $128 million USD in revenue in 2020. The only area where MyFitnessPal overlaps with Versatile Fitness, though, is in the workout routines feature set. This 
  area of the app includes a library of multi-exercise routines which can be customised by the user. The user can pick and choose which exercises they would like to do in 
  each routine as well as number of sets and reps. Each exercise is accompanied by a video displaying how to perform it. There are trainer tips, and time gates including a 
  rest interval between exercises (MyFitnessPal 2021). These are all similar features to what Versatile Fitness offers; however, MyFitnessPal doesn’t have any aspect of 
  child-involved workouts and doesn’t market itself specifically as a time-friendly at-home workout app. Though the overlap of features isn’t large between MyFitnessPal and 
  Versatile Fitness, due to the share of the market that it commands it will be a difficult process to try and convince people to try a different app. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Another wildly successful fitness app is FitOn, which launched in 2019 and has over 4 million registered users. FitOn offers a social workout experience from your 
  home by offering pre-recorded classes of many different types that you can attend virtually with your friends. It allows integration with wearable technology, and leader 
  boards aimed at fostering friendly competition. You can sync FitOn with your google calendar helping you organise your workout routine around your schedule. You can set a 
  fitness goal and form a specific plan with a custom length; you can fill your plan with your favourite classes. There is a notification system which can be set up to remind 
  you on specific days to ‘get your fix’ (FitOn 2022).  FitOn doesn’t quite offer any overlapping features that Versatile Fitness offers but there are overlaps in concepts, 
  such as the notification customisation, though Versatile Fitness leans more into keeping the user motivated via quotes and encouragement. Another overlap, though not a direct 
  feature overlap and more of a goal overlap, is the calendar, giving the user a tool to fit exercise into a busy schedule. Versatile Fitness takes a more on-the-go approach 
  to time management where the user can drop what they are doing and get a quick workout in. Both approaches may appeal to similar demographics so there may be some 
  competition there. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Sworkit is a company with an accompanying fitness apps that was launched in 2012, which now has 10 million registered users. Sworkit offers highly customisable workout 
  routines with features that include, workout time, length of each exercise, rest breaks between exercises, which exercises are included in the current workout and 
  instructional cues allowing you to change what your trainers voice sounds like. Sworkit offers access to certified fitness trainers through means of an in-app help centre, 
  where the user can ask for tailored advice regarding their fitness goals or even nutritional guidance (Sworkit 2022). There is an obvious overlap in Sworkit and Versatile 
  Fitness, and with a 9-year head-start on development Sworkit is no doubt ahead of us. Where these overlaps lie are in the workout presentations, though this kind of 
  functionality is very common across many fitness apps. Where the rarer overlap between these two apps occurs is in the exercises being offered to children. Sworkit has an 
  application called Sworkit Kids. This app is full of workout routines designed to engage and entertain children of all ages (Sworkit Kids 2022). Though from what I could 
  find in my research, Sworkit Kids doesn’t offer mixed workouts for parent and child, they seem to be more aimed at groups of children specifically. Both Sworkit and 
  Versatile Fitness have a mission to tackle adult and childhood obesity in their communities. Where Versatile Fitness differs from Sworkit is in the emphasis Versatile 
  Fitness places on parent and child interaction during a workout, fostering healthy habits to prevent obesity from occurring in the child at all. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> The fitness application market is vast and varied, there are many fitness apps that do many different things. All the features in Versatile Fitness are spread out 
  in other apps, barring the parent and child interaction, on the market, but I didn’t come across one app that has all the features Versatile Fitness has in one place. 
  For this reason, I think Versatile Fitness can find a niche in the landscape and become a viable market force. </p>

  <h3> Detailed Description </h3>
  <br>	
  <p style="font-weight: bold;color: yellow"> AIMS </p>
  <br>	
  <p style="font-weight: bold"> Specific Aim </p>
  <p> The specific aim for our Versatile Fitness application is to develop and release an app that helps busy people increase their fitness levels. The way 
  our application will accomplish this is through developing the habit of exercising daily. The focus will be on short five-to-fifteen-minute calisthenic workout 
  routines that are developed by qualified physical training instructors, to ensure intensity and strength requirements are met for effectiveness. The most 
  important parts of our project will be ensuring the exercises are effective with the short workout times, and ensuring the workouts are versatile so they can 
  be performed anywhere, without extra equipment. We know how hard it is to prioritise exercising when there are other more immediate concerns that you feel should 
  be taken care of instead. Recent studies from the Australian Bureau of Statistics found that 67% of Australian adults were overweight or obese 
  (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2018). Being overweight or obese comes with all sorts of health problems such as high blood pressure, high levels of bad 
  cholesterol, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes, just to name a few (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2021). With these numbers we can clearly see there 
  is a need for weight loss to promote healthier Australians. Therefore, our specific aim is important as the people most at risk of neglecting exercise are parents 
  or people in general that feel they are too busy. Our plan is for our application to provide a way for the time constrained people to still enjoy the benefits of 
  exercising, without the need for any time-consuming commitments they can’t fit into their busy schedules. </p>
  <br><br>
  <img src="images/app_logo.jpg" alt="App logo" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 25%; height: 25%">
  <br><br>
  <p style="font-weight: bold"> Goal One – Create a variety of workout plans for different fitness levels </p>
  <p> One of our main goals with the Versatile Fitness application is to support a wide range of fitness levels for people in all walks of life. Discrimination is 
  something that is easily visible in the health and wellbeing sector, and we want to completely eradicate that with our application. To achieve this goal, we have 
  sought help from trained professionals to develop us base workout plans to help us understand and develop further ones. At the current time we have gained a full 
  workout plan for an intermediate level from an acquaintance that is a CPL PTI (Corporal Physical Training Instructor). With the information and planning he has 
  given to us; we plan to scale the workout up and down to accommodate multiple fitness levels. Along with our connection with the CPL PTI, we have been communicating 
  with primary school PE teachers with multiple years of experience to help us intergrade the children element into our application. Gaining information from someone 
  who has worked with kids for some years, will help us understand what kids like and what they do not, which in a workout environment is especially important. 
  This information we gain over the next few weeks will aid us in achieving our goal of full support to all that wish to workout, by supplying them with a workout 
  plan that has been provided by trained professionals. These workout plans will be available in multiple fashions to accommodate those in a rush, those with kids, 
  those who want to experience the full workout and those who want to get their health into shape but feel their daily lives interfere with that goal.  </p>
  <br>	
  <p style="font-weight: bold"> Goal Two – Incorporate Kotlin/Java programming code in application to add features </p>
  <p> While the long-term aim of Versatile Fitness is to develop a fully functional android application, in the short-term we have set goals to produce some fully 
  functional sub-features using the Kotlin language. This way we can demonstrate aspects of the functionality of the final product and further, we can demonstrate 
  our ability to code with purpose in a language that is growing in popularity, fully supported by Google, and fully interchangeable with Java. <br><br>
  Some features we aim to demonstrate in the first ten weeks of development include: <br>
  •	Countdown timers for the workouts <br>
  •	Workout selection page with multiple workout choices available <br>
  •	Exercise screen that includes: <br>
    o	Exercise name <br>
    o	Rep number <br>
    o	Gif image showing required movements for exercise to be done in a safe and effective manner <br>
    o	Text indicator of how many exercises required in total <br>
    o	Stopwatch of overall workout time <br>
    o	Next exercise button <br>
    o	Quit button <br>
  •	A ‘next’ button which changes the exercise in the same fragment <br>
  •	A congratulations page for after all exercises are completed, returning user to the main menu <br>
  •	A quit screen with a ‘restart workout’ button and ‘return to main menu’ button <br><br>
  In the January 2022 index from TIOBE, which takes information from across the internet, Kotlin is placed as the 29th most used programming language, up from position 
  40 in 2021. Whilst not the most used language, it is a newer language, and language adoption is a slow process. We have chosen Kotlin due to its concise manner and 
  simplicity, as well as the close support it receives from google. 
  </p>
  <br>	
  <p style="font-weight: bold"> Goal Three – Develop a user-friendly interface for the mobile application </p>
  <p> For users to enjoy using our application, it is crucial to develop a user-friendly interface. Heuristic analysis is a popular approach in user interface designs. 
  Our application will apply Nielsen’s heuristic principles to provide a user-friendly interface since it will increase usability, making users want to use our application 
  and return to it. Faria Gomes and Costa de Souza (2021) explain that users use mobile workout apps for three reasons: (1) to achieve a task, (2) to be entertained and (3) 
  to socially engage with others. We will aim to apply these needs of the users when designing our interface. We will try to make our application visually minimalistic, 
  simple enough that users do not feel that they are exercising their brain to find out how this application is working or to help users not feel the need that they must 
  learn how to use this application to start working out with it. Especially for time constrained parents, it is important to make steps easily understood and make the app 
  easy to use. There will be simple instructions displayed across the application, especially for new users so that users can easily navigate across the interface and 
  application. There is an opportunity to gamify the workouts which will engage users and heighten their experience. Social interactions will also be made enjoyable with 
  appealing designs on the interface so that the social connection becomes a motivational and feel-good boost for users. With an easy-to-use interface and visually pleasing 
  aspects, our application will not only be a health benefit for users but become an enjoyable experience for users. </p>
  <br>	
  <p style="font-weight: bold"> Goal Four – Finalise application, debug, and find users to test the application </p>
  <p> Several steps will be required before the app can be released for beta testing. Firstly, before releasing the app the code should be run through the debugger built 
  into Android Studio, which will find and flag any errors in the code, followed by testing the app within Android Studio. Next the app can be tested in Android Profiler, 
  which is also built into Android Studio. This will determine how the app interacts with the memory, network, and battery of the device it is installed on. The app will 
  then need to be versioned. Version information is required for any maintenance or upgrading plans. Android requires all apps to have a digitally signed certificate, 
  signed with an upload key, before they will allow the app to be made available in the Google Play store. Once all these steps are complete the app is ready for beta 
  testing. Beta testers can be found in several ways. They can be personally sourced. There are also communities on social media, including Reddit and Facebook, made up 
  of people who will offer their services. It should be decided how many testers will have access to the app. The feedback from the testers will allow us to modify features 
  of the app dependent on the recommendations made. This goal is important as debugging and testing the app will allow us to ensure the app runs smoothly, doesn’t crash, 
  and the user experience will be enjoyable. </p>
  <br>	
  <br><br>
  
  <p style="font-weight: bold;color: yellow"> Plans and Progress </p>
  <br><br>
  <img src="images/plan_image.jpg" alt="Planning image" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 25%; height: 25%">	  
  <br><br>
  <p> Versatile fitness started as Bryce's A1 project idea and has now become the focus of Group 8. During our initial meetings we struggled to develop a new idea and 
  decided to improve on one of our own. We concluded that Bryce's fitness app would be the most realistic for us to achieve so we started brainstorming on ways to further 
  develop the idea. The original idea came to Bryce after he had his first child, and he realized that it was becoming hard to maintain a stable workout routine whilst having 
  to care for his child and work. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Since selecting Bryce's application to be our focus, all five of us came together to work out what the foundations of the app should be and how it should work in a 
  real environment. During our first meetings we planned what we needed to achieve in a planning sense to get our application development off the ground. We determined that 
  our focus in the application should be to include children for those new parents that cannot take a break and those who struggle to maintain a balanced workout routine. 
  We wanted to achieve this by having multiple workout routines and options to suit all, we also wanted to focus on a morale boosting feature that encourages the user to 
  work out, whether this be via a push notification or simply within the app. Since deciding on this project, we have had multiple meetings and have progressed through A3 
  to a point where we can comfortably identify what we want with the application. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Since planning our application we have started development in its initial stages, this is to hopefully end with a fully functioning application. We have created 
  several artefacts that display our visions and intentions and plan to use them to our advantage when developing. Bryce managed to get a hold of past contacts who are 
  familiar in the field of health and wellbeing. One of them, a CPL PTI (Corporal Physical Training Instructor) who gained knowledge from his service in the army and is 
  also fully qualified as a civilian physical trainer with a Diploma in Fitness. He wrote us one intermediate workout plan that we plan to scale up and down as a basic 
  guideline to our multiple workout routines. Another connection we have gained is a primary school PE teacher by the name of John Pilske. Mr. Pilske will be a huge asset 
  to us, as we aim to focus on the applications' ability to include children. Coming from a section of learning that involves fitness, Mr. Pilske will be able to teach us 
  ways to control children doing work outs and how to keep them focused and involved with learning how to exercise. A deeper look into our workout plans and suppliers can 
  be found on our website's artefacts page. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> So, with a foundation for the exercise components of our application, we then started to focus on how the application would appear to the user. In our artefacts 
  section on our website, you can see multiple slides on what our intentions are for the app's visual elements. When users first install the application, they will be met 
  with a selection of questions asking about their body's information such as height and weight, what fitness level they believe they are, what their goal is and whether 
  they will be exercising with children. After users give the information required, they will be asked whether they wish to link certain social media platforms, this will 
  play a part in our sharing ability on our app where users can share results and workouts across different platforms. After this, we have multiple different mockups of how 
  we want the user interface to look and react to the user’s input. There are multiple screens showing how the main menu will look, what exercises can be achieved, how the 
  workouts will be displayed to the user and a lot of your traditional settings and profile looking menus. One of our slides also shows our plans to develop a working forum 
  where users can discuss amongst themselves, if they have a problem with the application, they can then use that forum to seek help. If a problem is not sorted, we have 
  displayed the intention to allow developer contact so we will always have direct contact with a user if a problem arises. </p>
  <br>
  <p> One of the more impressive artefacts though is our navigation graph for our application. This graph shows us how we want our application to work essentially. The 
  graph can be used to trace where a button press, or selection will take you within the app. This graph would be extremely useful in the event we recruit a new member, 
  as they will be able to grasp how the application works without needing too much direction. The navigation graph is also the best place to see all our design intentions. 
  This will be incredibly useful when making graphic design elements to make the application not only pleasing to use but pleasing to look at. With all our artefacts sorted 
  we have started to develop the basic structure of the app in android studio. In its current form, we have the basic groundwork for the application that has some 
  functionality and is made up of Kotlin and Java code some of us in the group are learning from other courses, or have gained prior knowledge in. The application in its 
  current form can launch on the AS emulator but has a hard time loading when under stress. We have noticed that the application cannot load when viewed in an MS Teams 
  meeting due to the amount of CPU load. Whether this is a limitation of MS Teams or it being an indicator that our application needs better refining, we have noted the 
  problem and seek to fix it. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> The application still needs a lot of work to become a well-rounded product. Luckily Bryce has wanted to make an application like this for some time. With the birth 
  of his child, he has identified what could be seen as a problem and is seeking a way to fix it. This is what IT (Information and Technology) is made for, to identify and 
  solve problems to aid everyone, and with our application we aim to aid a lot of people in all walks of life. So hopefully when this introduction unit is over, Bryce may 
  have some groundwork done for him to develop a dream application with our assistance, and we hope to see it come to fruition one day. </p>

  <br><br> 
  <p> The biggest barrier we have come across has been to do with the backend building of the mobile application. We have decided to use Android Studio to develop our 
  mobile fitness application and have been using it to create high fidelity mock-ups. However, we have come across some barriers with using Kotlin as our programming 
  language of choice, since the language and methods that were previously known to us are irrelevant with Android Studio and we require to relearn Kotlin and specific 
  methods to develop our app. At this current stage, there hasn’t been other barriers as a group and working collaboratively as a team. Everyone has been cooperative and 
  quick to respond to any changes that has been happening with the project. However, one of the biggest barriers have been time constraints. Since there are many features 
  we would like to include in this mobile application, which boosts the motivation of users and encourages users to continue working out, there are many aspects that we 
  must work on in this app. Hence, the time constraint is one of our biggest barriers that we are trying to work against. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> We have made many decisions regarding the features and interface of our application. Our application will feature a social forum where users can interact with other 
  fitness users and parents who are also working towards the same goal, to become fit with the limited time they have on their hands. But we have decided to further this 
  social interaction so that users can connect the application to their social media account. Users can post their progress and achievements to their social media platform 
  such as Facebook and post updates regarding their workouts. By allowing our app to link with other social media platforms, it will reduce the amount of times that the 
  user will have to log in to share their progress, motivational quotes, and achievements. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Each person will take part in the whole process, and we have decided to share the roles around, focusing on everyone’s strengths in each process in developing, 
  designing and the research for the application. Some research includes different workout modules that are used in other workout applications and different intensities. 
  We have also decided to get our fitness routines and schedules approved by a professional trainer so that our users can take faith in our app, that it could help users 
  get fit and healthy even with shorter workouts according to their time restraints. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Another aspect that we have decided on as a group is to focus on the notifications for the application. The main feature that distinguishes our app from other apps 
  is our notification feature. It will ring to remind users to complete their workout multiple times throughout the day. But it will not stop at being a reminder, it will 
  include inspirational quotes and encouraging thoughts to motivate users to use even the shortest time they can spare, to complete a workout. Our group has decided to find 
  ways that these notifications are not bothersome to the user and will offer that kick that will get them to complete their workout at their desired time. These include 
  modern and minimalist designs, short and sweet quotes and pictures which can make users feel better about completing their workout. </p>
  <br>
  <p> Some other features that we will include in this app are explanatory videos and background music. To enable music to be played in the background while doing workouts, 
  our application will enable music apps such as Spotify and YouTube Music to run in the background simultaneously with the option to link these apps with ours being 
  considered. The user can decide how to level out the music and the volume which they want the instructions, timer, or other audio from our fitness app to be compared to 
  their background music. The explanatory videos can also be played along with background music, but the user will have the option to decrease the volume of the background 
  music while these videos are playing or even have the music pause. These explanatory videos will help the users to maintain correct posture as they achieve their workout 
  and avoid injuring themselves, as well as alternate ways to do the exercise to lower or increase intensity. They will be short and concise, focusing on breaking the 
  exercise into steps. Users can choose to watch these explanatory videos once selecting a workout and are taken to the confirmation screen, right before the workout begins, 
  or not if they are a seasoned user. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Another feature is a goals and achievements function. These will add a level of gamification to the application which will motivate users to return to unlock more 
  achievements and enjoy their progress because they can visually see how much they have achieved. Some of the achievements will include working out 5 times a week or 
  working out 5 times in a row, working out for 5 minutes or working out for 20 minutes, completing a 100-burpee challenge and so forth. There will be different achievements 
  that users can unlock and share on their social forum or social media account which can give a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment to boost their motivation to 
  continue working out. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Currently we are working on different features of the project. We have designed a basic interface for the application and are continuously working through user 
  interactions and reactions. Since we are heavily focusing on our notifications, these are going through continuous ideas and changes to find a design suitable for users. 
  Also, with the interface we have chosen the colour theme for the application. Using mostly blue, white and shades of grey, to hopefully avoid unwanted distractions from 
  too many visual elements. We have a basic layout of the sequence things will run in, in the menu or navigation bars. There will be little icons beside the names on the 
  navigation panels so that users can more easily identify what each button will do or where it will take them. The social forum is also currently at work with links being 
  created to make it more interactive and user friendly. We would like this forum to be easy to share posts and motivate other users as well as find encouragement, so we are 
  working towards an efficient model. Gifs are also another part of our app so that users can watch those short clips to know what the current exercise is and what is coming 
  up. These clips are currently under work along with our workout programs. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Another area we are currently working on is getting more of our workouts approved by a professional trainer as we only have one plan approved so far. Since our app 
  will provide not only workouts, but child friendly workout programs, it is crucial to have our workouts approved by a professional trainer. Hence, we are at present 
  working with a professional trainer in getting more workouts and different exercises that can be simultaneously done with a child, no matter their age. Also, since users 
  would want a variety of workouts according to their needs, age, weight, level of difficulty and time constraints, it is possible that even in the future we will need to 
  continuously work with the professional trainer to create approved workouts. </p>
  <br>
  <p> In the future we will continuously work on our app development and hire professionals either through an app development company or directly hiring a coding 
  professional and interface designer to improve our app and the interface. We will try to work more on the social forum since it has unexpectedly taken more time to 
  develop. Also as mentioned before, we will continue to work on the workouts, with plans to film the videos and clips to incorporate into the application. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> As shown in figure 1.2 below, we are expecting to complete the prototype and have it prepared for user testing and beta-testing. An initial user test with a 
  prototype will help us to apply the user feedback and implement all the necessary changes both to simplify the app or to create more functions to improve user experience. 
  As seen in week 14 of figure 1.2, when the user feedback is applied, we will be able to have our final product ready for beta-testing and customer validation. This will 
  lead to our final step which is to upload the application to Google Play Store and find potential investors and make a pitch to the investors. </p>

  <img src="images/roles_image.jpg" alt="Roles pic" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 25%; height: 25%">
  <br><br>
  <p> To assist us in staying on track with our project, we assigned roles to each group member based on their strengths in the previous assignment. The roles 
  include Project Developer, Graphic and UI Designer, Project Analyst, Technical Designer, and Content Technician. The first three roles are specific with the 
  last two being general all-rounder positions. The first specific position of Project Developer was assigned to Bryce, as he has previous experience with HTML, 
  CSS, and Kotlin programming languages. The position is responsible for developing and updating the project, maintaining the webpage, and ensuring all group 
  members meet the required deadlines. Bryce demonstrated previously that he could compile our written information to make it flow nicely, and efficiently used 
  his coding skills to incorporate the information into our webpage. The next specific position assigned was Graphic and UI Designer. This position is responsible 
  for any graphic or design related elements in the project, our webpage, and main documents for the assessment. This position went to Noah, as he is very talented 
  with creative design and was responsible for all our graphics in the previous assessment. Rhiannon was assigned the last specific role of Project Analyst. This 
  position is responsible for determining the requirements of the project, creating a breakdown of the essential components to be distributed to the required group 
  members, and reviewing completed work. Rhiannon was assigned this position as she previously demonstrated great organisational skills, and an ability to interpret 
  the project and section it into smaller, more manageable sections. These specific roles are vital to the success of our project; however, the general roles are 
  just as important and are arguably the backbone of the entire assignment.  </p>
  <br>	
  <p> The first general role of Content Technician was assigned to Daniel. This position is responsible for high-level content writing, ensuring academic writing 
  is well structured, and formatting rules are adhered to. Daniel was assigned this role as he has demonstrated great attention to detail, high-level of academic 
  writing and referencing, and the ability to be an all-rounder. The final role assigned was Technical Designer, which went to Hannah. This position is responsible 
  for any creative and detail-oriented content, brainstorming new ideas, and adapting new concepts to our current project. Hannah was assigned this role as she has 
  demonstrated high levels of creativity in her work, coming up with new innovative ideas, discovering ways to implement these ideas to our current work, and 
  consistently providing detail-oriented and well-structured content. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Although we all have roles assigned to us, they are interchangeable, and no doubt will be changed regularly as different aspects of the project require a 
  different viewpoint or area of expertise. In conclusion, our group members have all proven that we can produce high quality work and are all quite flexible and 
  open to new ideas. This has given us a solid foundation to work from and taught us all to adapt to different roles when required of us.  </p>

  <br><br>
  <p> The software required to develop Versatile Fitness consists of: <br>
	•	Android Studio package version Bumblebee 2021.1.1. <br>
	o	Version 7.1.1 of the Android Gradle plugin <br>
	o	Version 7.2 Gradle <br>
	o	Android Emulator v 31.2.8 which emulated a Pixel 2 with API 29 <br>
	o	Android SDK platform-tools v 32.0.0 <br>
	o	Android SDK build-tools v 33.0.0 rc1 <br>
        <br>
	•	To stress test the app we used the Intel X86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer) v 7.6.5 which is an extension of the Android Studio emulator. <br>
	<br>
	•	Firebase version 29.1.0 was also used alongside Android Studio for some components of the application. <br>
	o	Firebase cloud messaging <br>
	o	Firebase RealTime Database <br>
	<br>
	•	Navigation component of Jetpack was used for fragmenting the elements within the app. <br>
	<br>
	•	Notepad++ V8.3 was used for code testing prior to implementation. <br>
	<br>
	•	Physical testing was conducted on a Huawei P30 Pro with API 30 and developer mode unlocked. USB debugging was used in conjunction with Android 
	        Studio on this device while physical testing occurred. </p>
 	 <br><br>
  <p> Versatile Fitness was targeted for API 29 but will work on any newer API. The oldest SDK that will run the app is version 17 which is Android v 4.2 Jellybean. 
  All the above listed software is free and does not require a license; however, a Google Play account is needed to work with Android Studio, which is also free. Of 
  the members in our team, Bryce has used Android Studio the most with around 100 hours of experience. Bryce, Daniel, and Hannah all have experience with various 
  programming languages including Kotlin, Java and Python. Specifically, Bryce has a Kotlin certificate in intermediate Android app development from Udemy, Hannah has 
  completed multiple university level programming courses using a variety of languages, and Daniel is studying Introduction to Programming at RMIT which uses Python. 
  The Xbox gamebar app which comes standard with windows 10 and 11 was used to film the app run-through of the artefacts. Bryce has extensive experience using the Xbox 
  gamebar app with over a thousand hours of World of Warcraft streaming. </p>
  <br><br>
	  
  <p style="font-weight: bold;color: yellow"> Testing </p>
  <br>	
  <p> To develop our application, we will need to go through a variety of tests ranging from in-house to real world users. After we have developed our first edition 
  of our application in Android Studio, we will need to pass some real-world tests before allowing it to go live to a selection of human testers. Android Studio will 
  supply us with the environment to not only create our application but also to test it on the fly. Emulation has become a huge part of application development, so we 
  plan to use AS (Android Studios) software emulation tool to push our application to the limits. AS emulation tool allows us to review our work in real time, checking 
  over our code to make sure it has been applied correctly and works within our application, this will be incredibly useful when adding additional features to avoid 
  code clashes. Once we are happy with our base product we must then move onto refining and debugging, fortunately this will be completely achievable in AS. Within AS 
  we will be able to use synthetic workloads to simulate average to heavy workloads. This will give us an idea of how our application will run under pressure, which in 
  an ideal world would be flawless, but realistically this will be met with challenges. When exposing our app to workloads that may be unrealistic, we will see bugs that 
  will need debugging. The bugs could be caused by bad code, bad assets or simply just restrictions in the engine. This will trial us in our ability to read and rewrite 
  code, which is a test of our own knowledge that will improve along production. </p>
  <br>
  <p> Once we are happy with our application, we plan to release it as a beta test to a select number of participants. Our ideal participants will be those who the 
  app is designed for. Firstly, we will need to find several new parents who have seen a decline in their physical activities since the birth of their child. Another 
  demographic we will need to find is people who do not feel motivated to work out, as these are the people we are seeking to support. Once we have worked out which 
  demographic we would like to test on, we will need to find a solution on how to gain access to those people. We will do this by using the “snowballing” technique. 
  We would first use the powers of social media to promote our testing. This would require funding assistance to advertise our product to locate potential testers but 
  would hopefully become self-sufficient after the first few hundred tests. In our test form we would include the option to share the test to family and friends, that 
  would hopefully result in the “Snowball” event. For example, one person could do the test and share it with their family of 4, that family of 4 could then share it 
  with their friends, which could provide us with upwards of 20 testers who would then share and could then repeat the cycle, hopefully infinitely. </p>
  <br>
  <p> With 25 million Australians, 67% of those being considered as overweight or obese (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2018), we would be targeting around 16-17 
  million people with our final product. To figure out the number of testers we need for accuracy, SurveyMonkey (2022) suggests taking the square root of your sample 
  size and dividing it into your population standard deviation, then multiplying the result by the z-score with your confidence level.  A population of 16 million 
  requires a sample size of 1,068 people resulting in a 3% margin of error with a 95% confidence level. For our overweight and obese population to achieve a 3% Margin 
  of error with 99% confidence level, we would need 1,849 participants in our tests. A margin of error of 3% may not give us all the information we desire so we would 
  personally be aiming for a participant rate of 16,624 Australians, giving us a goal of a 1% margin of error with 99% confidence level. During the creation of this 
  application, we will be using these trial-and-error tactics to test our app in its multiple stages. Using our own stress testing and debugging in its initial stages 
  to using the Australian population to see what we can improve on and what errors we may have overlooked. The end goal will be to have an application that is good for 
  the wellbeing of all that use and is also designed around what they want in an application like ours. </p>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;color: yellow"> Risks </p>
  <br>	
  <img src="images/risks_image.jpg" alt="Risks pic" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 25%; height: 25%">
  <br><br>
  <p> There can be many risks involved in developing a mobile application with so many apps available in the market. Some of those risks include too many features, 
  time constraints, limited knowledge of coding and risk of security breaches through our application. Fitness apps were downloaded 400 million times in 2021 
  (Curry 2022). With many options available on the app store, our application must have features which users need or want that cannot be provided by other fitness 
  apps. One of the risks our project holds is that users feel the goal of this app can be reached through other fitness apps and does not use our application. 
  Hence, our features such as child friendly workout plans, notification systems with encouraging quotes and the social aspects in sharing to online forums and 
  individual social media accounts, hopes to satisfy the wants and needs of the users. However, another risk we run into while adding these features is that there 
  is a possibility that our application is overrun with too many features. Since an application should try to focus on fulfilling a specific goal of the user, if 
  our application has too many inbuilt features, not only could it make the user experience more difficult and unappealing, but we may also have difficulty developing 
  a highly functional application within the given time constraints. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Although it is important to become familiar with the chosen software to develop the app and learn the programming language, with the time constraints in place 
  it could be a risk that we do not become familiar enough with the software in due time. We have started using Kotlin to start developing the application and have 
  come across a hurdle that there has been an update to the language for carrying out the tasks we would like. Hence, extra time is now required to relearn the language 
  and methods to achieve our goals with the interface and functions of our application. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Data protection, security and privacy are all now prevalent issues in the media regarding technology and smart phones. Security issues are also another risk that 
  our project could run into. He, Chan and Guizani (2015) explain that mobile application developers should ensure their app abides by security governance and does not 
  access unnecessary information. It is important to encrypt any private data that is stored both locally and on remote servers, as well as providing extra security 
  add-ons so that their application can fight against a security breach in the event the user’s mobile phone comes under a vicious malware attack (He, Chan and Guizani 2015). 
  In order to combat against any malware or security breaches, our application must have all the necessary features and certificates, but this can also challenge the time 
  constraints if our mobile application proves that it is not secure enough. </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Although there is a possibility of hardware risks and hardware crashes, since most of the work will be saved and backed up to collaboration cloud services such as 
  GitHub, it appears that any hardware risks can be decreased. Also, since more than one person will be working on the development of the application and many in the team 
  are currently android users, there will be many ways to work around any individual hardware problems that may arise. </p>
  <br><br>
	  
  <p style="font-weight: bold;color: yellow"> Group Processes and Communication </p>
  <br>	
  <p> Communication amongst our group has been great since we first formed for the previous assessment. We acquired some valuable communication skills and learned 
  the best ways to communicate with each other. In this assessment, we plan to utilise the same communication techniques we used previously with minor changes. 
  Everyone in the group will ensure they have MS Teams installed on their personal computers and their mobile phones. We will communicate regularly via MS Teams 
  chat interface to ensure everyone in the group is on track with their scheduled workload, and so we won’t be caught unaware if a personal matter arises that may 
  affect our deadlines. We will also hold video meetings using MS Teams video calls twice a week, considering everyone’s schedules so we can all attend. During these 
  video meetings we will make sure we have a chair of the meeting, an agenda, and someone to take minutes. We will generally run these meetings in a similar fashion 
  each time. Commencing with seeing how everyone is coping with the set deadlines for each section assigned, discussing any issues or barriers that may have arisen, 
  assigning new deadlines for the next scheduled meeting, and discussing best time for our next meeting.  </p>
  <br>	
  <p> We haven’t experienced any issues with group members not responding to communications since the first week of the last assessment. However, we have a detailed 
  plan in place if this does occur. We will first attempt to contact the group member via a direct personal message in MS Teams chat, if this doesn’t receive a response 
  within 24 hours we will send an email to their student email address. If we still don’t receive a response within another 24 hours we will execute a video call through 
  MS Teams in attempt to contact them. If we still receive no response we will then contact our course coordinator via student email, explaining the current situation and 
  the methods of communication we have attempted, requesting advice on how to proceed. Overall, we believe we have a solid plan in place to ensure our communication 
  remains to a high standard throughout the course, ensuring we are prepared for any unforeseen circumstances that may arise. </p>
