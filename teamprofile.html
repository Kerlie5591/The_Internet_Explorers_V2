  I am 30 years old and was born in Australia. I am Caucasian and Indigenous Australian, and I only speak English. I enlisted in the Australian 
  Army as an Advanced Medical Technician early in life. During my time in the Army, I received my Diploma in Nursing and Diploma in Paramedical 
  Science as well as other Certificates in the medical field. I went on to study my Bachelor of Nursing, and after discharging I completed my 
  Certificate IV in Business Management and my Certificate IV in Security Management. I love spending time with my small family, my wife Tanya 
  and daughter Katara. I enjoy living an active lifestyle and every week go skating, boating, or hiking as a family. I also enjoy online gaming 
  and reading fantasy novels. I love IT and enjoy building computers, I have dabbled in app and webpage creation; I quite enjoy programming and 
  app development. My current IT experience is limited, I have only ever pursued it as a hobby, never having worked in the field. I joined RMIT’s 
  Bachelor of Information Technology to learn as much as possible about IT and start a career that I will enjoy, I hope to gain the knowledge to 
  become a software developer or work in cyber security. </p>

  My name is Hannah, I was born and raised in Sydney. I fluently speak Korean and lived in China for a short period of time just before the pandemic 
  to learn Chinese Mandarin. I enjoy playing music and majored in classical piano. During the pandemic, I started learning to play the guitar 
  on my own while watching YouTube tutorials. My favourite hobby is travelling and during peak holiday seasons, I am usually holiday-hopping. 
  My main interests in IT are Cyber Security and Artificial Intelligence. During my studies in diploma of IT, I was interested by methods
  which cyber criminals use to infiltrate computers and access data as well as ways that could mitigate it. My interest in artificial 
  intelligence peaked after learning about Tesla’s revolutionary Autopilot features and the ethics attached to artificial intelligence. </p>

  My name is Noah Etherington. I grew up in Hobart, Tasmania and started my working career as a chef. My hobbies include Gaming, Social sports, Listening
  to music and most importantly bush walking. I am currently running a fundraising campaign for the Cancer Council Australia in support of my terminally 
  ill grandmother, for every Tasmanian Abel I summit I will be donating $10 to the foundation in hopes to raise awareness and aid in prevention of the 
  illness. My interest in IT stems from building custom computers for friends and family and I hope to develop further knowledge in the software side of 
  computing. The Internet Explorers is a team made up of myself, Daniel, Hannah, and Bryce (Name creator) and we hope to aid each other in upcoming projects.</p>

  Hi, I’m Daniel, I’m a member of The Internet Explorers along with Bryce, Hannah, Noah and Rhiannon. I was born and raised and currently live in 
  Canberra, ACT. I'm Australian with a Māori heritage and I speak English. My passions include gaming, travelling, science, and hiking. I am interested 
  in artificial intelligence, what it can offer humanity, and the ethics involved in a quickly growing field with huge potential impact. I am specifically 
  interested in the field of machine learning and its ability to make sense of vast amounts of information. I’m also interested in computer hardware, I 
  enjoy building computers (then gaming on them) and keeping on top of current technology. For the past seven years I’ve worked as a polysomnographic 
  technician. This job requires acquisition, handing, and analysis of large amounts of biological data and a fair bit of client interaction. My goal is to 
  get the skills that will allow me to be a player in the developing field of artificial intelligence. </p>

  Hi, I’m Rhiannon, I live and work in Port Augusta, South Australia. I work full time as a data administrator in the rail industry. I’m a wife, mum, and 
  dog owner. In my spare time I like to create art and watch movies. I grew up in the 80’s and 90’s around computers and AV technology inspired by my dad 
  who had a love for all things IT. During quarantine I had a conversation with my best friend who is currently a year and a half into her Batchelor of 
  Social Work which she is completing online. I looked into what was now on offer and seeing that a wide variety of IT courses were available to me I jumped 
  at the chance. I am interested in software development, learning more about computer programming and cyber security. </p>

  <h3> Group Test Results </h3>
  <br>
  <img src="images/test_results_1.jpg" alt="Test results= Myers-Briggs and Learning Styles" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto"> 
  <br>
  <img src="images/test_results_2.jpg" alt="Test results= Other Psychometric test results" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto"> 
  <br>
  <p> Psychometric tests can help to determine the ideal composition of a group, and our combined test results show that we are well matched. In our group, 
  according to the test results, we have an assertive leader type with a strong sense of commitment and great attention to detail, a confident mediator that 
  can ensure everyone’s voices are heard and are treated fairly, two enthusiastic and strong communicators that are creative and capable of exploring new 
  ideas, and a determined, rational, and versatile individual that can bring focus to the group. With our group members knowing each other’s personality and 
  learning types, this enables effective communication and collaboration. For example, Architects tend to appear standoffish, yet this is due to them being 
  logical and can be perceived as being blunt. By understanding this, situations where tensions may arise due to other personality types perceiving Architects 
  as being dismissive can be discussed or understood before occurring. Another advantage is knowing who may be best suited to certain situations before they 
  occur. For example, we have a Mediator, this will be good because they are creative, passionate, open-minded, and empathetic. However, they can have tendencies 
  to be self-critical, which can lead them to have unrealistic expectations for themselves and beat themselves up when they don’t live up to these expectations.
  We also have 2 Architects and 2 Campaigners. This means we know we have two members who may need help to abide by deadlines and can be disorganised or unfocused, 
  but are talented in communication, enthusiastic, and perceptive. We also have two people who are solution focused and determined but can be single minded. </p>
  <br>
  <p> The advantage of knowing each group member’s learning style is also important, especially when collaborating over the internet. It allows the group to utilise 
  techniques such as virtual whiteboards or transcripts of meetings to ensure each member can learn in the opportune way for them. Even if these psychometric 
  tests are not 100% accurate for everyone, they provide a basis on which the group can utilise to work effectively, particularly at the start of a collaboration 
  when individuals may not have experience with group work or specific team members. With all our team members understanding each other’s personality and learning 
  styles, we will be well-equipped to handle any challenges that may surface, and ensure we work well together to complete all tasks efficiently and effectively. </p>
  <br><br>
	  
  <h3> Group Processes </h3>
  <br>
  <img src="images/teamwork_image.jpg" alt="Teamwork pic" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 30%; height: 30%">
  <br><br>
  <p> Everyone in our group believes we had fantastic communication and worked incredibly well together. We made sure to check in on each other regularly and made 
  contact every day, with everyone always being respectful. This had a positive effect on the group environment and our morale was always high, even when we were 
  overwhelmed by deadlines. All group members attended meetings on time and we all equally contributed to the assigned work. We all showed genuine interest in each 
  other’s personal lives and were willing to provide support whenever necessary. Throughout the assignment we all maintained our motivation and provided the best 
  possible work we could. Overall, our group enjoyed working alongside one another and we all believe we did the best we could. However, as all groups have some areas 
  that are weak points, so did we. During the last assessment we would silently review each other’s work only when asked and were always making sure to not offend 
  others, rather than providing true constructive criticism. We also failed to accurately prioritise different sections by importance, even though we completed all 
  the work by the deadlines. This led to sections that required the information from other areas to fall behind in the long run, forcing us to drastically increase 
  our workload and pace during the last week before submission.  </p>
  <br>
  <p> For assignment three, we as a group will be reflecting on our previous strengths and weaknesses as highlighted in our reflections, to overcome the barriers we 
  identified during the last assignment. More specifically, we will be changing a few minor processes to ensure we maintain motivation and a consistent pace throughout 
  the assignment, rather than having slow periods and fast periods. To ensure consistency of our work, we will include a discussion section in MS Teams for reviewing 
  and proof-reading each other’s work. We will make sure everyone has their work reviewed prior to uploading to our Git repository or including in our main document, 
  and ensuring we provide constructive criticism instead of protecting each other’s feelings. We will also make sure we all read and completely understand the criteria 
  of assignment three and work together to create our own breakdown of the assignment, then assign sections by priority. This will ensure the process is smooth and no 
  one is waiting for anyone else to finish a section before they can commence their own work. These changes to our processes will encourage us to improve our overall 
  quality of work and set us up for future success. </p>

  <h3> Career Plans </h3>
  <br>
  <p> Bryce, Noah, and Rhiannon all chose Software Developer as an ideal job. While Hannah chose Cyber Security Analyst, and Daniel chose AI Research Scientist.  
  These three jobs, while being very different from each other, also have a lot of elements in common. According to the Burning Glass Data, Personal skills differed 
  little between the three careers. The importance placed on being able to communicate effectively, both orally and in written form, ranks very highly for all three 
  jobs. The need to be able to integrate well into a workgroup, no matter the size or project, is also very important. You must be able to organise yourself and your 
  workload effectively to succeed in these jobs. Attention to detail is important and presentation skills are required so that you can effectively share your ideas 
  with clients, employers, and co-workers. </p>
  <br>
  <p> There are also technical skills that are similar in both jobs. Knowledge of programming languages such as C++, SQL, JavaScript, and Java are the top requisites 
  in the IT Specific Skills list from the Burning Glass Data for all three jobs. Experience with operating systems also ranked highly, with Windows and LINUX featuring 
  predominantly on the list. The differences between them are predominantly down to the level of education required for each career. Although it is recommended, Software 
  Developers don’t necessarily require a degree or formal education, just a provable knowledge and experience with the programming languages utilised by the company. 
  Cyber Security Analysts, often need a degree in IT, Cyber Security, or Computer Science. They must also have or be able to quickly acquire an understanding of the 
  required knowledge and industry specific laws and standards, as these differ from company to company, as well as from country to country. Research Scientists need the 
  highest level of education out of the three, a master’s degree or doctorate in either Computer Science or a similar tech field. Their knowledge base must be more 
  technical, with provable experience in machine learning, algorithms, and computer architecture. They must also provide proof of research skills with either first 
  author publications or projects.  </p>
  <br>
  <p> When comparing our ideal jobs and their common elements, we can begin to see what differentiates the three different careers from each other. Although there are 
  only slight differences between the skills required for them, the actual careers are quite different. Software Developers are professionals who use Information Technology 
  principles and varying programming languages to develop, test/debug, and review software (Malvik 2020). In contrast, Cyber Security Analysts work for organisations to 
  protect their IT systems from potential cyber-attacks, by identifying weaknesses in their systems and developing intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and other defensive 
  systems (Indeed Editorial Team 2021). According to Eleven Fifty Academy (2021), both careers utilise programming as a key component of the job, Software Developers require 
  a more in-depth knowledge of programming languages and is more of a creative career path. In comparison, Cyber Security Analysts focus more on security measures for 
  computer systems (Eleven Fifty Academy 2021). When comparing these two careers to an AI Research Scientist, there is quite a difference. Research Scientists in the AI 
  field develop machine learning programs and techniques and are required to research and document the agenda they are working on. They collaborate regularly with other 
  fields in the organisation to produce high quality research data and innovative machine learning techniques. As defined by Gwynedd Mercy University (2021), 
  AI Research Scientists require in-depth knowledge of AI programming skills, high analytical thinking, and strong research skills. Although they utilise the same programming 
  languages as the other two careers and have some similarities, a research scientist career differs greatly as they are mainly research oriented. They focus heavily on 
  gathering research data, interpreting, and verifying the validity of the data, identifying connections, and forming logical conclusions (Joshi 2018).  </p>	
  <br>
  <p> When reviewing our group’s individual career plans, we notice that most of the generic and technical skills required for our roles are very similar, and all three 
  careers require in-depth knowledge of the same programming languages. Our career plans require different qualifications; however, the required knowledge and experience is 
  generally the same. The only real noticeable differences in our career plans are the qualification levels required for our dream jobs. In summary, the basic skills for these 
  roles are very similar and all require an understanding of IT technology and the industry. All three careers require the ability to work well and communicate with others, 
  with the main difference for these roles being the level of further education required, and the different ways their skills are applied in the industry.  </p>
